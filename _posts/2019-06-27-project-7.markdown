  <h4>About this project</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">As part of an eight-person team, we explored the niche of erotic games for platforms like Nutaku. We developed a working prototype that combined clicker mechanics with dating sim elements, where the player interacted with characters through chats, dates, and a reward collection system (photos).</p>

  <p class="text-justify">Although the pitch was well received, we identified that the team needed more experience in live ops and monetization to scale the project. Despite this, the prototype demonstrated solid technical design and gameplay.</p>
