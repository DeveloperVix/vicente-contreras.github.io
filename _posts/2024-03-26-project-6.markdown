  <h4>About this project</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">First title published on Steam, a chaotic party game where:</p>

  <p class="text-justify">
   <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>Up to four players control cardboard boxes that fight in a wrestling ring.</li>
        <li>Multiple game modes: Classic tag team or handicap matches, 1 vs. 1 with the AI, and single-player story mode.</li>
        <li>Physics-based gameplay means every move and hit can have different results.</li>
        <li>Sets inspired by real-life wrestling venues such as Madison Square Garden, Tokyo Dome and Arena Mexico.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="text-justify">A project that defined my personal development methodology, overcoming technical and emotional challenges to achieve its launch. This project was created by a total of four people, including myself. We also collaborated with an audio production studio, Policrom, which was responsible for the soundtrack and all the game's sound. The game took four years to develop.</p>
