  <h4>About this project</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">The first (and only) project developed under the TrickShot label for an external IP (Axel the Dragon). The game combined tower defense (inspired by Plants vs. Zombies) and runner mechanics, adapting to the narrative of the dragon Axel.</p>
  
  <div class="left-aligned-content">
  <p class="text-justify">Key Details:</p>
   <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>Two iterative versions:
         <ul>
          <li>V1: 10 pure tower defense levels.</li>
          <li>V2: 15 genre-blending levels + Flappy Bird minigame.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Monetization via virtual store (power-ups, characters) and interstitial advertising (optional videos).</li>
        <li>Transmedia content: Story told through integrated videos and digital comics.</li>
   </ul>

  <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Programming and implementation:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Development of hybrid core gameplay (changing mechanics per level).</li>
        <li>Integration of monetization systems (store, ADS with Unity).</li>
        <li>Creation of the Flappy Bird minigame as an Easter egg. But with the main character, Axel the dragon, included.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>UX/UI Design:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Usability tweaks based on early feedback (e.g., menu flow, clarity of power-ups).</li>
        <li>Adaptation of assets provided by the client to ensure visual consistency.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Challenges and Learnings</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Working with External IP:</strong> Creative constraints when adapting pre-established designs and narratives.</li>
    <li><strong>Genre Shift:</strong> Difficulty balancing progression between tower defense and runner levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> The importance of documenting technical decisions in third-party projects (for future updates).</li>
