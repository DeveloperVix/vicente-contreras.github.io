  <h4>About this project</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">Inspired by the cosmic horror atmosphere of Bloodborne (From Software) and the mythos of H.P. Lovecraft, this mobile prototype offered a real-time tactical combat experience. The player takes on the role of a cursed soldier who must enter a city plagued by aberrant creatures to save his family, gradually uncovering the truth behind the curse.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">Unlike traditional souls-likes, the game prioritized a gesture-based combat system (swipes and taps on the screen) to execute attacks, dodge or block, creating a dynamic similar to "real-time turn-based combat."</p>

  <h4>Challenges and Learnings</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Combat Balance:</strong> Difficulty balancing real-time speed with the required precision of gestures.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototype Limitations:</strong> Lack of resources to refine visual feedback (e.g., clear hit animations).</li>
    <li><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> The importance of validating complex touch mechanics early.</li>
