  <h4>About this project</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">The latest iteration of the TrickShot Games project (another attempt at creating a video game studio), focused on exploring monetization through Unity ADS. The game combines 3D puzzle mechanics with procedural level generation, where the objective is to find hidden "vortexes" in a dynamic environment. The player rotates platforms with unique effects (e.g., acceleration, bounce) to avoid obstacles and reach the goal, encouraging experimentation with physics.</p>

  <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Gameplay Programming and Game Design:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Procedural level generation system, ensuring variety and replayability.</li>
        <li>Advanced 2D/3D physics integration (Unity 2021+) for realistic object interactions.</li>
        <li>Implemented Unity ADS (banners and interstitials) with player journey analysis to maximize revenue without breaking the experience.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Art and Production:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>3D modeling in Blender (characters and interactive elements).</li>
        <li>UI/UX design in Photoshop (sprites and intuitive interface).</li>
        <li>Creation of the first game trailer using Adobe Premiere (editing and visual narrative).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Publication:</strong> Complete management of Google Play Store releases, from optimized builds to metadata (description, icon, screenshots).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Challenges and Learnings</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Balance between ad frequency and player retention (study of basic metrics such as session length).</li>
    <li><strong>Copyright-Free Art:</strong> The Learning Curve for Original Asset Design and Royalty-Free Audio Selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Physics tuning for mid-range mobile devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> Early core loop validation in procedurally generated games.</li>
