  <h4>About this project</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">Third attempt at founding a studio in Morelia, consolidated after joining the LABEM incubator (2020). Evil Geometry was born as a collective of four developers, evolving into a label with:</p>

  <p class="text-justify">
   <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>Focus on iterative prototypes: Use of game jams (Global Game Jam) and quick projects to define identity.</li>
        <li>Validated business model: Training in marketing, finance, and legal topics thanks to LABEM, a business incubator in Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico.</li>
        <li>Local recognition: Ranked among the incubator's top 15 projects, with investor interest.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
