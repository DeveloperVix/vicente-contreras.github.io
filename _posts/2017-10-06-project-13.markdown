  <h4>About this project</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">I participated in the last Campus Party Mexico under the challenge of Alienware Latin America, whose objective was to create a video game that represented its range of computers in an interactive environment. The restrictions included the use of assets provided by Alienware and that the game be playable in a web browser.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">I developed a top-down shooter with a narrative based on protecting an alien station (an analogy to hardware defending itself against viruses). The player had to survive for two minutes using three types of weapons and a unique mechanic: dimension shifting to confront enemies on different planes. The project was selected among the top 20, giving me the opportunity to present it to Frank Azor (co-founder of Alienware).</p>

  <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Weapon system with three firing styles (burst, laser, area).</li>
        <li>Parallel dimension mechanics increase complexity, as each dimension contains specific enemies, so you have to switch between them to defeat them.</li>
        <li>Enemy AI with A* algorithm for intelligent pathfinding.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Creative Adaptation:</strong> Use of assets provided by Alienware, integrated with copyright-free art and audio elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Browser Optimization:</strong> Development in Unity, adjusting the project for the Web, ensuring compatibility and performance in browsers.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Participation:</strong> Game presentation in a competitive environment, with industry feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Challenges and Learnings</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Difficulty Balance:</strong> Lack of time to fine-tune gameplay balance (e.g., weapon damage, enemy spawn rate).</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> Working with web technology and external assets under a tight deadline (2 months).</li>
    <li><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> The importance of prototyping key mechanics before polishing artistic details.</li>
