  <h4>About this project</h4>
  <p class="text-justify">After the original TrickShot team disbanded, I decided to continue as a solo developer, exploring classic genres to further my skills. Invader (the name intentionally misspelled as a marketing ploy) was an arcade spaceship shooter designed with the philosophy: "easy to learn, hard to master."</p>
  
  <p class="text-justify">The game offered a pure and addictive experience:</p>

  <p class="text-justify">
   <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>Limited horizontal movement (to emphasize positional strategy).</li>
        <li>Automatic firing, allowing the player to focus on dodging bullet patterns.</li>
        <li>Variety of enemies and bosses with battle phases, increasing gameplay depth.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <div class="left-aligned-content">
  <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Gameplay Programming and Game Design:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Balance between accessibility and challenge (progressive difficulty curve).</li>
        <li>Memorizable yet challenging boss attack patterns (inspired by simplified bullet hells).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Implementation of some design patterns for better performance on mobile devices, such as singleton and object pooling.</li>
    <li><strong>Process:</strong> Complete Google Play Store upload process (build, metadata, and asset management Post-launch retention and difficulty analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Challenges and Learnings</h4>
  <ul class="styled-list">
    <li><strong>Game Design:</strong> First serious approach to risk-reward balance in shooters (e.g., rewards for getting close to enemies).</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> Lack of polish in visual feedback (e.g., clear indicators of damage taken).</li>
    <li><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> The importance of the first 30 seconds of gameplay to capture the casual player.</li>
