            With over 10 years of experience in video game development, I've worked on multiplatform projects (mobile and PC),
            both as an independent developer and collaborating with clients to bring their visions to life.
            My expertise includes the design of innovative interactive experiences, from immersive games to Augmented Reality (AR) applications for marketing campaigns,
            brand activations, and interactive commemorations.
            My goal: to create experiences that transcend entertainment and leave a memorable mark.
